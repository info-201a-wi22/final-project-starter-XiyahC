## What is this file for?

* This file will eventually become your project report for **P02: Exploratory Data Analysis**. Specifically, you will write rmarkdown to report your exploratory data analysis.

* Please see Canvas for more details.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Source Data and Load to View
```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Sourced the code to data_access.R file 
# load the dataset with load_data()
source("../source/data_access.R")
```

### Dataset Information and Summary
```{r summary_info, echo=TRUE}

```

> This dataset has **`r summary_info$vars_size`** variables and **`r summary_info$obsv_size`** observations, collected data from **`r summary_info$min_year`** to **`r summary_info$max_year`**.  
> There are four pollutants recorded, they are NO2(**`r summary_info$NO2_unit`**), O3 (**`r summary_info$O3_unit`**), SO2 (**`r summary_info$SO2_unit`**), and CO (**`r summary_info$CO_unit`**).  
> **Column Names:** `r summary_info$col_names` 

## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

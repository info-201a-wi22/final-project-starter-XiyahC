|Abstract | We are concerned with the air pollution trends in the U.S. during the time from Jan. 2010 to Dec. 2016, because the air quality is closely related to human activities and will significantly affect human health. To address this concern, we plan to use the dataset from _data.world_ to come up with useful analysis and to visualize the possible trends of the U.S. air pollution situation. Therefore, we can use the results of the analysis to find existing air-pollution problems and to generate useful solutions.|
|Keywords | “environmental science; air pollution; major pollutants”|
|1.0 Introduction | In recent years, we have seen a great increase in air pollution, which leads to a lot of environmental problems. We are really concerned about this problem and want to explore more about it. Therefore, we search the database related to this topic, from which we can see the level of air pollution in different states in the U.S. The elements that the database uses to represent the air pollution are four major pollutants which are NO2, O3, SO2, and CO. Units, Mean, AQI, 1st Max Value, and 1st Max Hour are five variable latitudes to show the level of air pollution. When analyzing the data, we need to figure out what the five variable latitudes stand for. In the result of the analysis, we hope to find the relationship between states and air pollution and the trend of air pollution over the years. We also want to analyze the possible elements (locations, human behavior, economic development…) behind it.  |
|2.0 Design Situation | **Framing the topic of concern**: Our topic addresses the scientific issues related to the Air Problems in the U.S. There are many pollutants related to the Air Pollution Level, if the Air Pollution problem is not treated seriously, then it might cause a series of natural disasters.                       **Human Values**: Health awareness should be the big part connected to our topic of concern. The value seems to be originated from the truth that air is the substantial thing that human beings need to maintain their livings. Also, it will indirectly affect our health by negatively causing global warming and the sea level rising, which will increase the spread of diseases. This will hugely impact human health. **Stakeholders**: The direct stakeholders of our topic are those who are really interested in air pollution topics, and who are concerned about the environment which will affect human activities and health. They should have the values of environmental protection and healthy lives for all humankind. The indirect stakeholders would be all human beings around the world since we are all relying on air to breathe and we all need fresh air to live a better and healthier life. Besides human beings, there are all other kinds of living in the world, such as plants, animals, and soil. They are also counted as indirect stakeholders.**Benefits and harms**: If interventions are taken with data and technology, air pollution might be controlled at a certain level which will neither limit human development(either on technologies or weapons), nor negatively impact the global environment on Earth. However, there could be the risk that before we, humans actually have the ability to control air pollution, the air pollution have already grown to the level that is irreversable. And the technology we are developing might accelerate the impacts of air pollution in a negative way.|
|3.0 Research questions | 1. Which air pollutant can be the most serious to air pollution?— This helps us to decide the importance of each latitude level when we are analyzing the data. We cannot decide the relevant level of an element simply by its numerical value, so finding the influential level helps us to analyze the data better.2. Different solutions for relieving different types of air pollutants.— Air pollution brings a great influence to our environment and we don’t want to just analyze the situation of air pollution in different states in the U.S. We want to do more to help improve air pollution. Since air pollutants are the major elements to cause air pollution, it is important for us to find solutions for reducing them.  3. What are the possible reasons behind the most seriously polluted states in the U.S.? — We are curious why some states have the most serious air pollution, but some states do not. The reason may be related to economic factors, geographic differences, or human behavior. It is important for us to figure them out so that we can find solutions to solve them. |
|4.0 The Dataset | The dataset has 778, 254 observations, and 28 variables. The data represents the level of four major pollutants(Nitrogen Dioxide, Sulphur Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide, and Ozone) for every day from 2010 to 2016 and the specific locations and date the data was recorded. There is a user of Kaggle, BrendaSo collected the data from the database of U.S. EPA around 2017. She originally scraped all data from U.S. EPA because she did a related project with her friends in college to help other data-scientist to use this pre-scrapped dataset to do further analysis. It is trustworthy since U.S. EPA is an official government agency. We saw the dataset from Kaggle, then we go to the _data.world_ website to download the neat .csv file which contains all the data we need. Yes, we do credit the source of the data as one of our references. |
|5.0 Expected Implications | We hope people will raise their awareness of air pollution and get to know more knowledge related to reducing air pollution, like using more public transportation. The school should help students to cultivate the environmental protection consciousness. The community can also get involved to educate residents of the importance of reducing air pollution. We also want the government to regulate the emissions of air pollutants and make rules of buying cars. There can also be a discount for taking public transportations. However, different states have different reasons that lead to air pollution, so governments of different states should apply professional technologists to find out the main reasons and figure out the most reasonal solutions. Besides, the car designers are encouraged to design more functions that can reduce the emission of air pollutants.  |
|6.0 Limitations | The data in the database is only updated to 2016 so some of the data anlyzed may not be useful in the current environment. In recent years, glaciers have retreated further due to global warming caused by worsening air quality. The composition of air becomes more complex and variable over time. Many factors can affect air quality. There are many sources that may not be checked due to missing data about air pollution. And because of the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus in 2019, the USA entered a very tense state, and it influenced so many people’s daily life. These external factors may become the limitations and affect the analysis of data. |
